# Elder Fraud Detection

This project is part of the Applied Data Science Master's program at the University of San Diego.

## Intro and Description

The goal of the project is to identify suspected elder fraud in digital payments using data mining. As the use of digital payments and banking increases, it becomes more important to detect fraud to prevent vulnerable populations like the elderly from being targeted. The scope of the project is to take digital payment data, analyze it, prepare it for modeling, and evaluate and test different data mining models.
