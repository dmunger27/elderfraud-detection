# Elder Fraud Detection

This project is part of the Applied Data Science Master's program at the University of San Diego.

## Intro and Description

The goal of the project is to identify suspected elder fraud in digital payments using data mining. As the use of digital payments and banking increases, it becomes more important to detect fraud to prevent vulnerable populations like the elderly from being targeted. The scope of the project is to take digital payment data, analyze it, prepare it for modeling, and evaluate and test different data mining models.

## Project Description

In order to better identify fraudulent transactions and prevent elder fraud in digital transactions, a machine learning solution was developed. Using data obtained from Wells Fargo, variables like transaction timestamp, customer state, and customer age were used to predict whether or not a specific transaction is fraudulent or not. The data was first cleaned and preprocessed, with repetitive variables removed and missing values dealt with. Next, the data was explored for relationships and distributions. Finally, models were fit, validated, and tested to determine which model resulted in the best F-1 score.
